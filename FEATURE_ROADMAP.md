## Priority 1: Core Learning Enhancements üî•
*These directly improve your learning experience*

### 0. **Hybrid Knowledge System** ‚ö° NEW
- Intelligent routing between textbook knowledge and model's classical literature knowledge
- Question classifier detects grammar vs literature vs hybrid queries
- Enhanced responses combining textbook accuracy with real literary examples
- Smart source indicators showing exactly what knowledge was used
- **Impact: VERY HIGH** - Unlocks model's deep classical Japanese training while maintaining textbook accuracy
- **Implementation Plan**: 4-phase rollout with question classification, routing engine, hybrid prompts, and enhanced UI

#### Decision Matrix (Routing)
- **RAG**: Strong textbook hits (Top‚ÄëK density high, avg distance ‚â§ œÑ) and question is grammar/meta ‚Üí cite textbooks only.
- **LLM General**: Low textbook hits and question requests literature/examples beyond textbooks ‚Üí allow general knowledge with clear ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù banner, no textbook citations.
- **Hybrid**: Medium textbook hits or mixed query ‚Üí combine RAG + general; clearly separate and label each.

#### Guardrails
- Prefer textbook content; do not attach textbook citations to claims derived from general knowledge.
- Label and separate ‚ÄúGeneral Knowledge‚Äù content from ‚ÄúTextbook‚Äëgrounded‚Äù content in the answer.
- Refuse or minimize out‚Äëof‚Äëscope requests when both RAG and general signals are weak; ask for clarifying context.

#### Metrics & Thresholds (Tunable)
- Hit density: fraction of Top‚ÄëK with distance ‚â§ 0.40 (start), adjustable via settings.
- Diversity: distinct sources among Top‚ÄëK (‚â• 2 preferred for high confidence).
- Router confidence: simple score from density + diversity; shown in UI header.

#### Evaluation
- Log route decision, hit metrics, knowledge mix (e.g., ‚ÄúTextbook 80% / General 20%‚Äù).
- Collect thumbs up/down and brief reason; compare by route.
- A/B against RAG‚Äëonly baseline to tune thresholds.

#### Phase Breakdown
1) Classifier + Signals: keyword heuristics + retrieval metrics produce route + confidence.
2) Routing + Guardrails: enforce output policy (citations only for textbook claims; ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù banner for others).
3) Hybrid Prompt & UI: prompt sections (Retrieved Context, General Knowledge, Synthesis Policy) and header indicator ‚ÄúSource Mode: RAG | General | Hybrid‚Äù.
4) Quality Loop: telemetry, user feedback, threshold tuning and documentation.

  - KANJIDIC2 for kanji readings, meanings, stroke counts (CC BY‚ÄëSA, via EDRDG)
  - Optional later: classical filters via JMdict misc tags (e.g., ‚Äúarch‚Äù for archaic) and custom classical addenda
- Distribution format:
  - Keep originals in `data/dicts/raw/` (XML)
  - Convert to normalized JSON in `data/dicts/json/` with schema: `headword`, `reading`, `gloss[]`, `pos[]`, `tags[]`, `source`, `licenses`
  - Store LICENSE and attribution alongside converted JSON
- Pipeline:
  - Script `scripts/fetch_dicts.py` downloads latest JMdict_e and KANJIDIC2 from official mirrors
  - Script `scripts/convert_jmdict.py` converts XML ‚Üí JSON (multi‚Äësense flattening, POS/tags normalization, classical tag extraction)
  - Versioning with date stamp; do not commit raw XML to repo by default
- App integration:
  - Settings ‚Üí ‚ÄúLoad Public Dictionary‚Äù: one‚Äëclick fetch + convert + load into memory index (uses existing lookup UI)
  - Toggle: ‚ÄúClassical only‚Äù (filters by archaic/older‚Äëkana tags when available)
  - Fuzzy search fallback (optional) when exact/substring misses
- Performance & storage:
  - In‚Äëmemory index with NFKC normalization; shard by headword initial for fast prefix search
  - Optional vector index for gloss search reuse (small model; opt‚Äëin)
- Legal & UX:
  - About/Settings page shows CC BY‚ÄëSA attribution for EDRDG datasets and links to licenses
  - Respect license on export (include attribution in exported snippets)

## üß† Hybrid Knowledge System - Detailed Implementation Plan

### **Technical Architecture**

**New Files to Create**:
- `question_classifier.py` - Classify questions as TEXTBOOK/LITERATURE/HYBRID/AUTO
- `knowledge_router.py` - Route to appropriate knowledge source
- `prompts/literature_expert.md` - Literature-focused prompt template
- `prompts/hybrid_expert.md` - Combined textbook + literature prompt

**Enhanced Files**:
- `rag_assistant.py` - Add hybrid query methods
- `app.py` - UI controls for knowledge source selection
- `ui_components.py` - Enhanced source indicators

### **Phase 1: Question Classification Engine** (Week 1)
```python
# question_classifier.py
class QuestionClassifier:
    LITERARY_KEYWORDS = ['poem', 'poetry', 'genji', 'tale', 'kokin', 'manyou', 'author', 'work']
    GRAMMAR_KEYWORDS = ['particle', 'auxiliary', 'conjugation', 'tense', 'form', 'grammar']
    HYBRID_KEYWORDS = ['example', 'usage', 'appears', 'used in', 'how does', 'literature']
    
    def classify(self, question: str) -> str:
        # Returns: "TEXTBOOK", "LITERATURE", "HYBRID", or "AUTO"
```

### **Phase 2: Knowledge Source Router** (Week 2)  
```python
# Enhanced rag_assistant.py
def query_hybrid_stream(self, message, knowledge_mode="auto"):
    if knowledge_mode == "auto":
        knowledge_mode = self.classifier.classify(message)
    
    if knowledge_mode == "HYBRID":
        return self._query_with_both_sources(message)
    elif knowledge_mode == "LITERATURE": 
        return self._query_model_literature(message)
    else:
        return self._query_textbook_only(message)
```

### **Phase 3: Hybrid Query Engine** (Week 3)
- Two-stage approach: Get textbook context, then enhance with model knowledge
- Literature-aware prompting that encourages classical text citations
- Smart source attribution showing both textbook pages AND literary works

### **Phase 4: Enhanced UI & Indicators** (Week 4)
- Knowledge source selector in chat interface
- Enhanced source display with textbook + literature sections
- Color-coded indicators for different knowledge types

### **Success Criteria**
1. ‚úÖ User asks grammar question ‚Üí Gets textbook explanation + literary examples
2. ‚úÖ User asks about specific classical work ‚Üí Gets rich model knowledge response  
3. ‚úÖ User sees clear indication of knowledge sources used
4. ‚úÖ Responses are more comprehensive without losing accuracy
